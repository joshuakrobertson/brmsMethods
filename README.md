# brmsMethods
brms methods required to evaluate a non-linear hypothesis from a dataframe and not a brmsfit

Note that all functions were produced by Paul Buerkner and are house as methods in the R package brms (2020). The function "hypothesis_df" contains slight modifications from the "hypothesis" function found within brms that permit inclusion of custom priors when a data.frame is used for hypothesis evaluation and not a brmsfit.
